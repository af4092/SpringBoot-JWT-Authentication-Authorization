## [Troubleshooting](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39632667/how-do-i-remove-the-process-currently-using-a-port-on-localhost-in-windows)

- Sometimes when we run the Spring application which in default listens to `port:8080` we get the `port in use` error. In this case we open the terminal and check port: 8080 and kill the PID which is listening to port.
